                sugar, and 1 egg until smooth.
                Scoop the dough onto a parchment or Silpat lined baking sheet. (Roll into 1″ balls with your hands, if
                you do
                not have a scoop.)
                Press down with the back of a fork and then press again from the opposite direction, to form the
                criss-cross
                pattern on top.
                Bake for 12 minutes and then let cool on the tray for 1-2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to
                finish
                cooling. Store in an airtight container.</p>

                under
                1/4-inch is perfect).

                2 eggs (large), room temperature
                1 cup granulated sugar

                1 1/2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice (use 1 1/2 to 2 Tbsp)

                Steps
                1. Line a 12-count muffin/cupcake tin with cupcake liners. Preheat oven to 400˚F. In a large mixing

                thick and
                light in color.

                2. Add 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup oil, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt. Set the mixer to low speed and mix
                just
                until combined.
                In a small bowl, add 2 cups flour and 2 tsp baking powder and whisk to combine. Using a hand held whisk,
                add
                flour mixture into the batter 1/3 at a time, stirring with each addition just until incorporated. DO NOT
                OVERMIX or muffins can become dense.
                Add 2 tsp lemon zest 2 Tbsp lemon juice and whisk in just until combined. Use a spatula to fold in 1 1/2
                cups
                blueberries, folding just until combined.
                Divide batter into muffin tin filling liners to the top or until all of the batter is used up.
                3.Bake at 400˚F for 20-22 minutes or until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center come
                out
                clean without wet dough. Remove muffins from tin and cool on a wire rack until room temperature then
                drizzle
                with lemon glaze.

                4. How to Make Lemon Glaze Recipe:
                In a small bowl, combine 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp lemon zest and 1 1/2 to 2 Tbsp lemon juice,
                adding
                lemon juice until desired consistency is reached. Stir until smooth. To thin the glaze more, add a
                little
                lemon juice or water. To thicken, add a little more powdered sugar.
